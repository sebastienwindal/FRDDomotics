# FRDDomotics 

_under development_.

[See project page here](http://sebastienwindal.github.io/FRDDomotics/)

Playground in the area of home automation. My plan is to have

* HW: a raspberry pi monitoring/controlling various z-wave sensors all around my house
* Server side: A Node.js/restify rest server
* Client side: A native iOS app and a Angularjs web app.
